            <h3>Role: UX | UI Designer </h3><br> <br>
                <h4>THE PROBLEM: <br>
                    When planning a trip with a group it is difficult to take everyone’s schedules into account. Not only is planning travel dates around schedules tough, but it is also hard to plan the trip itinerary to please everyone’s wants and goals.<br> <br>
                    THE SOLUTION: <br>
                    The Buddy System app will create a platform for Travel Buddies to easily plan a trip together that works for everyone’s schedule and trip goals.<br> <br>

            <div ><h1 class="once">Once apon a time...</h1>  <h3 class="step1">I worked in an office where I serviced about 50 client's tech needs. My clients were traveling about 70% of the year and constantly ask me to make them some sort of shared calendar that their travel buddies could communicate through. After playing around with and setting up all kinds of shared calendar apps and websites for these clients I realized that I was actually doing research. I then set out to create Buddy System. I shared calendar/travel planning app that meets the needs of travelers everywhere!<br> <br>

             <h3 class="step1">I began by compiling all of research and additional user interviews to better understand users wants, needs, and behaviors while traveling <br>
             <img class="interviews1" src="images/BuddySystem/bsinterviews.png"> <br> <br>

             I analyzed these finding using an Affinity Diagram <br>
             <img class="interviews" src="images/BuddySystem/bsaffinity.png"><br><br>

            Then used that information to really understand the user's feelings<br>

                <h3 class="step1">User Insights: <br><br>
            Noah needs a simple  way to compare his friends’ schedules and wants for their upcoming trip so he can plan a stress free vacation that caters to everyone.
During my research I discovered that all subjects find planning trips around all parties’ schedules, wants, and goals one of the most difficult aspects of organizing a trip.
How might we easily gather all travel buddies’ schedules and wishlist for our trip so that Noah can plan a vacay that pleases everyone. <br> <br>

Problem Statement:<br><br>
When planning a trip with a group it is difficult to take everyone’s schedules into account. Not only is planning travel dates around schedules tough, but it is also hard to plan the trip itinerary to please everyone’s wants and goals.

            </h2><br>

             <h3 class="step1">I then conducted research on what features were most important in achieving the Buddy System's goals.<br>

             <img class="interviews" src="images/BuddySystem/bsFeaturePrioritization.png"><br><br>
The Pain Points of focus are scheduling travel around multiple Travel Buddies' schedules and planning an itinerary that please everyone. <br><br>
The top priority features implicated to solve these problems will be interactive shared Calendars and Trips.<br> <br>
 The shared Calendar is available for all Travel Buddies to display their available travel dates. And, the Trips feature will allow all Travel Buddies, that are included on that particular trip, to share a map, create an itinerary, and share their location throughout the trip. Users can create more than one trip at a time.

        <!-- Prototype -->

            <div ><h2 class="step1">With a clear idea of what features are necessary I created a user flow. This tells me how the user will move throughout the site. <br>

            </h2><br>

             <h3 class="step1">The UI Design process began with sketches. This makes an easy edit process but allows me to quickly test our features impact on the user.<br>

             <img class="interviews" src="images/BuddySystem/bssketch2.png"> <br>
             <img class="interviews" src="images/BuddySystem/bssketch3.png"> <br><br>

             I then produced low and mid fidelity mockups for user testing.<br>
             <img class="interviews1" src="images/BuddySystem/bslofiproto.png"><br><br>

         <!-- Test -->

         <div class="steps">
            <div><img src="images/5test.png" class="empathizePic"></div>

            <img class="interviews" src="images/BuddySystem/bstest.png">
            </h2><br>

             <h3 class="step1">Three iterations were formed after sessions of user testing. Once the overall layout and concept was decided on I began accessability and color testing. I then created a styleguide and UI design <br>
                <br>

        <!-- Finale -->

        <div class="steps">

            <div ><h2 class="step1"><br>
            <img class="interviews1" src="images/BuddySystem/bshifi.png"><br> <br>
            
            This new design solves the main issues learned from the organization stakeholders and site users:<br>
        -Information Hierarchy and Site Navigation<br>
        -Funnels users to get involved, advocate, and donate to Bike Austin<br>
        -Provides a clear calender of events for Riders to join<br>
        -Clearly displays bike safety and education <br> <br>
